# 0x11. Heap Sort

## Tasks

### 0. Heap sort
Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Heap sort algorithm

* Prototype: void heap_sort(int *array, size_t size);
* You must implement the sift-down heap sort algorithm
* You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Heap sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

* in the best case
* in the average case
* in the worst case
